Initially, Yasumasa Morimura’s Daughter of Art History resembles a parody from MAD Magazine: most of the painting mirrors Manet’s Impressionist classic A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, yet, instead of a corseted blonde barmaid in the centre, a nude Japanese man in drag gives a blunt stare as he demurely crosses his hands over his chest. A bouquet of white roses is conveniently placed below his waist. This bizarre displacement has become the signature style of Osaka-born artist Yasumasa Morimura. From Manet’s Olympia to Audrey Hepburn, Morimura reconstructs the most prominent women from the Western cultural canon as self-portrait versions through costumes, makeup, and digital modification. His cheeky pastiches entertain and satirize interpretations of what is beautiful, but his art is more than just a cheap gag. By literally placing himself as an often-female subject in reconstructions of famous Western paintings, Morimura explores artistic, sexual, and cultural appropriation and challenges former notions of representation and self-identity.

Many American and European contemporary artists explore identity politics and themes of presentation/representation in their art.Art historian Lisa Tickner in her essay Sexuality and/in Representation cites the theorization of the gendered subject as a crucial component in modern ideology:
The result was a shift in emphasis... to recognition of the processes of sexual differentiation, the instability of gender positions, and the hopelessness of excavating a free or original femininity beneath the layers of patriarchal oppression. 'Pure masculinity and femininity,' as Freud remarked, 'remain theoretical constructions of uncertain content.’
Instead of relying on gender binaries and historical conventions about sexuality, European intellectuals began to explore the complexity of sexual diversity and the murky distinction between pure masculinity and pure femininity. Instead of being limited to the stereotypes of the passive or sexualized Woman and the muscular and courageous Man, contemporary artists now examine representation in terms of the fusion of gender positions within an individual identity.

Just as Tickner investigates femininity in art and gender distinction— or lack thereof— Morimura challenges contemporary femininity by placing himself as the female character in several pivotal Western artworks. He inserts himself in roles intended for the West's most revered icons of white, feminine beauty. In doing so, he disputes the previous functions these icons have played in visual culture. What are the roles of each subject now that a modern-day man has replaced the original figure?

In 1997 Morimura exhibited a collection at Saatchi gallery featuring photos of the artist as different stars from the silver screen like Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman, and Marilyn Monroe. The gallery’s catalogue asks how Morimura alters the role of the image by altering different aspects of the original photo: "Can Brigitte Bardot be as innocently flirtatious with angular Japanese features? Would Marilyn Monroe be as sexy if she were Japanese - and a man?” Morimura blurs the lines between masculinity and femininity, prompting the viewer to reconsider precisely what makes Marilyn Monroe a sex icon: is it because of her feminine form? Is it her revealing outfit and heavy makeup? Morimura brings these questions to the forefront of modern discussions regarding gender and representation.

Within the dialogue of representation lies the more nuanced critical concept of appropriation. Critics debate the extent to which an artist can appropriate ideas before plagiarism occurs. In Makers and Takers: Art and the Appropriation of Ideas Henri McKervey and Declan Long argue that to recognize plagiarism is to assert a bold declaration: how can one so dauntlessly declare that she knows originality when she sees it? While he condemns plagiarism which does not directly reference the source, McKervey asserts that culture flourishes with borrowing, adaptation, and derivation. “The question of ‘knowing originality when you see it’ is almost beside the point in some cases,” argues McKervey. “Artists’ strategies of appropriation prompt questions of originality to become thematically intriguing.” Although the artwork has been interpreted in previous eras, the contemporary viewer must discover for herself why the artist chose to reintroduce the artwork at this particular time. As Cornel West states, “the new cultural politics of difference consists of creative responses to the precise circumstances of our present moment.”  Even if the artwork’s physicality changes minimally, the artist’s choice to recontextualize reveals a social commentary that modernizes the original piece.

Morimura’s Daughter of Art History examines the boundary between plagiarism and appropriation and causes the reader to examine these differences for herself. Morimura creates heavily referential works (Fig. 2, 3). More than half of each piece of art is a direct copy from a classic Manet or Kahlo. He sharpens the line between plagiarism and appropriation, however, when he adds his own social commentaries to previously accepted classics. By changing the gender, race, and social role of each main subject, he transforms the purpose of each artwork. He asks the viewer to reconsider the roles of each subject and thus creates an entirely new piece of art. In doing so, he invites the viewer to reconsider the original painting in light of his social comments. Morimura uses appropriation to both reference and challenge existing norms.

When exploring appropriation, many critics cite Duchamp as the artistic forefather of this concept. David Hopkins goes into great detail comparing the artwork of Sherrie Levine, whom some may call the pioneer of contemporary appropriation, with that of Marcel Duchamp in his essay “The Politics of Equivocation: Sherrie Levine, Duchamp’s ‘Compensation Portrait’, and Surrealism in the USA.” In particular, Hopkins examines Levine’s After Walker Evans, in which Levine takes a photo of a sharecropper’s wife in Depression-era Alabama (originally taken by documentary photographer Walker Evans) and re-presents an exact copy as her own work. “It was one of a sequence in which she could be seen as usurping canonical images by modernist Masters of photography for femininity. More broadly it could be seen as instantiating the Duchampian strategy of appropriation as a defining hallmark of postmodern art production.” While many credit Levine for charting new territory in terms of appropriation and artistic possession, Hopkins reveals that Duchamp made a startlingly similar conceptual statement in Compensation Portrait, in which Duchamp reprints a photograph of a woman taken by documentary photographer Ben Shahn in the same manner as Levine’s After Walker Evans. Instead of discrediting Levine, however, Hopkins merely emphasizes the prominence of Duchamp’s ideas in contemporary art.

One may highlight appropriation’s cultural heritage through comparing Duchamp’s L.H.O.O.Q. with Morimura’s Mona Lisa series. L.H.O.O.Q., one of Duchamp’s ready-mades, is a postcard of da Vinci’s Mona Lisa with a goatee and moustache penciled on the subject’s face (Fig. 4). Duchamp shocked early 20th century critics with his apparent disdain for one of the most iconic art figures of all time. In drawing masculine facial hair on the model of Renaissance beauty, Duchamp challenged gender norms in an unprecedented way. Morimura’s Doublennage / Mona Lisa features an exact copy of da Vinci’s Mona Lisa but, as always, Yasumasa’s blank face gazes out instead of the original subject’s face (Fig. 5). Duchamp and Morimura both dare their viewers to re-assess the “sanctity of Western art and concepts of artistic creation and originality.” Through his ready-mades and initial appropriations, Duchamp laid the groundwork for the possible success of contemporary artists like Morimura. 

Yasumasa Morimura takes past traditions of Western culture and art history and calls them into question by placing himself, a Japanese man, in the role of the female subject. Instead of abiding by the norms of gender and sexuality that existed before the 20th century, he reconstructs them as a foil to contemporary thought regarding sexual differentiation and individual mutability. Morimura manages to satirize and simultaneously create an homage to his source material, questioning the role of representation in contemporary art but still honouring the Masters of the past. Morimura respectfully and boldly explores notions of representation and self-identity in the simultaneous destruction and adulation of these icons that create the fabric of Western culture. Interpretations of art are mutable; they change depending on the beliefs and values of the people viewing them. By interposing himself in the dearest works of the Western anthology of art, Morimura deconstructs former notions of the world’s favourite paintings. By changing the way his audience views the past, he changes the way viewers see the future.
