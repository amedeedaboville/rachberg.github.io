In 2011 the Victoria & Albert Museum chose a photo of Grace Jones as the cover of their exhibition *Postmodernism: Style and Subversion*. In the photograph, the pop diva modelled an outfit that would make Duchamp proud: she wore a multicoloured, dress-like structure composed of 3D scalene triangles, ice-hockey pant legs for sleeves, a pink paper fan and a bold red exclamation point on her forehead. Grace Jones’ style epitomizes the radical visual freedom of the 1980s.

The video for her 1985 hit 'Slave to the Rhythm' is postmodern maximalism to the extreme. This video is packed with astonishing images, from bionic Grace Jones-sphynx garages to chicken-costumed people painted different colours; it is an aesthetically indulgent but captivating piece of art.

 Despite its ebullience, many of the visuals are icons of racism:  there are instances of Blackface and a photo of Jones, nude, snarling from within a cage. As the viewer, it’s hard to define what should be condemned as oppressive and what should be pardoned for the sake of art. Through this video we can examine the conflict between the exuberant freedom of 1980s art and the cultural memories of slavery, orientalism, and injustice which exist today.




### 'Slave' and Slavery

The opening shot of 'Slave to the Rhythm' is a white hand using an X-Acto knife to cut a photo. As the song begins, the next frame shows the cutter slicing the face of Grace Jones, making her trademark snarl, into two pieces.

The opening of a song titled 'Slave to the Rhythm' depicts the disfigurement of a black woman— already this is a provocative move. The trauma of slavery, violence, and disfigurement of Black people is a painful part of the common memory in North America. Jones, a Jamaican woman, exists in this context of colonialism and violence. Could this trauma be altered— erased, even — when we see it in a lighthearted, modernized space like an art pop video? Theorist Jill Bennett writes that trauma is lived and negotiated at an intersection, an in-between; it is neither objective nor subjective and it's hard to define its exact influence in an artist’s work. Bennett writes about artists who explore trauma via sense memory and how art registers the shock of trauma. Instead of intimately examining common suffering, though, Jones attempts an antithesis to trauma-engaged art. Instead of clinging to the context of slavery she manipulates the images and attempts to free them from the memory of trauma. She completely dismantles the historical and racial contexts in favour of aesthetic freedom, letting us construct different meanings for once-traumatic symbols.




### A 'Post-Racial' Society

The 'Slave' video exaggerates and reverses racial differences, reinforcing the idea of 'post-racism' from the 1980s. In post-Civil Rights USA and especially in the late 20th century, many Americans had idealized notions about our increasingly globalized— and therefore post-racial— world. Since theoretically all Americans had the same rights, there was no need to focus on issues based solely on class or race. 'Whiteness studies' emerged in universities. Movies appeared with plots transcending race boundaries. Whites as civil rights soldiers, sentimental renderings of cross-racial relations, and 'spectacular fantasies of a post-racist US-based new world order' like *Independence Day* (1996) peppered pop culture. In 'Slave' there is a montage of white people working in factories and bustling as waiters. Meanwhile Grace Jones sings:

>Work all day, as men who know  
>Wheels must turn to keep, to keep the flow  
>Build on up, don’t break the chain  
>Sparks will fly, when the whistle blows  
>Never stop the action  
>Keep it up, keep it up  

The repetition and emphasis on productivity mimic a plantation slave song.  
When hearing these lyrics with visuals of white slaves bustling, Slave  
exemplifies this post-racialism. In *My Name is Forrest, Forrest Gump: Whiteness Studies and the Paradox of Particularity*, Robyn Wiegman explores 20th century 'whiteness' through the 1994 film. 'In the liberal white fantasy of *Forrest Gump*, the descendant of the founder of the Klan can emerge at the end of the twentieth century shorn of his damaged patriarchal inheritance, which is to say that the intimacy of familial, personal relations has now been successfully separated from the past and tied instead to a prototypically American future. In the process, white power and privilege are displaced from any inherent relation— historically, ideologically, politically— to white skin'.

In a sequence in 'Slave,' there's a light-eyed person painted black and a dark-eyed person painted to look Caucasian.

The tradition of Blackface was a reality in recent history, so using black-painted people in a video is shocking. By having the 'Blackface' and the 'Whiteface' look at each other, 'Slave' implies that we are beyond the trauma of the past. The white privilege in original Blackface performances has dissolved— or, it’s been displaced from her usage. 
	

### 'Slave' and Self-Orientalism

Jones uses ‘Slave’ to nullify the history of orientalization and animalization of the Black female by exotifying herself. One of the shots in 'Slave' is of Grace Jones on her hands and knees, nude and oiled, snarling at the camera from inside a metal cage. There are slabs of raw meat inside with a sign saying 'DO NOT FEED THE ANIMAL'. The music video's director, Jean-Paul Goude, used the photo as the cover of his 1982 book *Jungle Fever*:

Edouard Said wrote, 'European culture gained in strength and identity by settling itself off against the Orient as a sort of surrogate and even underground self'. Although Said discussed Europe’s orientalizing of Asia, his ideas apply to other exotification. Early on, Europeans defined the Black female as the Other— a hypersexual, inhuman object. When Jones poses as a vicious, caged, naked woman, she acknowledges and embraces the animalization of the Black woman. Is Jones’ blatant exotification tolerable because she is the agent, the artist redefining the images? Yes, it's possible that she displaces the power by owning her self-exotification. It is essential to analyze, however, exactly what agency Grace Jones had. Jones did not write the song; it was instead a team of three white British men. The video was directed by French photographer (and her lover) Jean-Paul Goude, who explicitly orientalizes and sexualizes Black women in his book titled *Jungle Fever*. We can't say how involved Jones was in the creative process of her song and music video, but we must consider the influence of the white men on her supposed 'agency' before we pardon such exotification.

### Conclusion

'Slave to the Rhythm,' with its chaotic creativity and provocative images, simultaneously demonstrates the best and the worst things about postmodernism. The artistic freedom to be irreverent and turn accepted Truths upside down is what we love about it. At the same time, postmodernism tends to be only for those who have enjoyed the fruits of colonialism— the educated elite in a position derived from histories of colonial and racial exploitation. Mocking the traumatic history of colonized communities 'for art’s sake' is problematic. It adds insult to the injustice, insensitivity and total disconnect of the affluent that exists in our 'post-colonial' world.
