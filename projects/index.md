Here you'll find my past experience in user experience design.

### Semantria

In May-August 2014 I worked as a product intern at <a href="https://semantria.com/">Semantria</a>, a cloud-based Natural Language Processing API startup. As part of a site-wide redesign, I revised and restructured the documentation and all support materials for their <a href="https://semantria.com/support/developer/">API</a> and their <a href="https://semantria.com/support/excel/">Excel plugin</a>.

# Personal Projects

I'm always working on personal projects about contemporary art, cognitive science, cultural analysis, and social empowerment.

### Turtle Island Films

I taught myself Ruby and bit of a Rails to make a database for films with Native American and Indigenous directors, producers, and screenwriters. I used data from Sundance Institute's Native Film Program and IMDB.

### Benefits of Thrifting with Parallax

I built a website about the environmental, ethical, and personal benefits of buying secondhand. I built parallax scrolling for the site using only CSS.

#### More to come!
